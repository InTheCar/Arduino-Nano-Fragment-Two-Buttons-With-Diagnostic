## Why another button for the Arduino?
This two buttons are supervised by the Arduino. The following events will be detected by the Arduino:
1. Button 1 pressed
2. Button 2 pressed
3. Button two has the higher priority -> if Button one and two are pressed the Arduino will "say" button two is pressed
4. Shortcut to ground
5. A wire two the buttons are disconnected.
